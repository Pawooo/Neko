# Neko Finder
Help lost cats find a new home

## My first Laravel project from the ground up. 

Everything you see (except some icons and Neko photos) is made by me. MVC paradigm-based full CRUD, authentication, 1:M relationship web application. Did not use any UI libraries to fully test my vanilla CSS/JS knowledge (including latest features like animationend, @layer, clamp etc). 

Users can register homeless cats or just cats they want someone to pick up and other users (unregistered as well) can provide their contact info for further discussion on a per-cat basis. 

Obviously, even if you apply via dialog – nothing’s going to happen, because it’s just a project I needed to show I’m worth my junior salt in Laravel.

I summed up my Laravel 9 findings in a multipage cheatsheet that might contain small inconsistencies, but based on it you can definitely build your own project without having to Google and experiment as much as I did.  

## Other things I learned here: 
1. Animating Dialog from display:none (::backdrop sync is quite “face-dropping” as some Japanese speakers might say)
2. All things related to Laravel (from RESTful routing and CRUD to diverse DB seeding and authentication)
3. Efficient use of clamp()
4. Gradient border setup (In compliance with hypnotoad specifications (嘘))
5. <button> and <a> elements within the same parent styling
6. Form styling (it’s hell even with introduction of accent-color)
7. Sometimes it’s far easier to use @keyframes/animation in combination with Lottie, might save you a lot of code lines
 
## P.S.
Be blessed by bokeneko and bakeneko.
